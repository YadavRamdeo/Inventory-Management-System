Add, update, and delete products from the inventory with details such as name, description, quantity, and price.

Order Management:
Process incoming orders by updating stock levels and managing order details like customer info, order status, and quantities.

Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Backend Framework: Django
Database: MySQL / SQLite
Frontend (optional): React.js
Other: Django Rest Framework (for API)
Example Use Case
Managing Products:
As an admin, you can add a new product like a "Laptop". The product details include:

Name: Laptop
Description: High-performance laptop
Quantity: 50
Price: $1000
Processing Orders:
When a customer places an order for 2 laptops, the system will automatically update the stock level, reducing it from 50 to 48.

Stock Alerts:
If the stock of any product falls below a predefined threshold (e.g., 5 units), the system will send an alert to notify the admin to restock.
